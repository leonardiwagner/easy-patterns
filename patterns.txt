creational
    builder
        - handles complex objects creation
        - handles constructors with a lot of parameters
        - handles when you can have a lot of differents constructors
        - immutability, since dont expose getters
        - focus to build an object step by step.
        - used when you cant build an object in one step
    factory
        - build and object in one step
        - dont expose instantiation logic
        - wrapper function around constructors

structural
    decorator
        - add functionalities to existing objects dinamically
        - it wraps the object
    proxy
        - provide access to other object control it
        - provide a smaller object for other thats too complex
        - want to decouple your code for an remote one
